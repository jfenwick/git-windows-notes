You should not use the Open SSH client that comes with Git for Windows. Instead, Windows 10 has its own implementation of Open SSH that is integrated with the system. To achieve this:
1. Start the `ssh-agent` from Windows Services: 
  - Type `Services` in the `Start Menu` or `Win+R` and then type `services.msc` to launch the Services window;
  - Find the `OpenSSH Authentication Agent` in the list and double click on it;
  - In the `OpenSSH Authentication Agent Properties` window that appears, choose `Automatic` from the `Startup type:` dropdown and click `Start` from `Service status:`. Make sure it now says `Service status: Running`.

2. Configure Git to use the Windows 10 implementation of OpenSSH by issuing the following command in Powershell: 
```
git config --global core.sshCommand C:/Windows/System32/OpenSSH/ssh.exe
```

3. Configure SSH to automatically add the keys to the agent on startup by editing the `config` file found at `$HOME\.ssh\config` (full path - `C:\Users\%YOUR_USERNAME%\.ssh\config`), and add the following lines:
```
Host *
	AddKeysToAgent yes
	IdentitiesOnly yes
```
  You can also add the following lines if you generated an SSH key with custom name or multiple SSH keys:
```
Host github.com
	HostName github.com
	User your_user_name
	IdentityFile ~/.ssh/your_file_name
```

4. Add your SSH key to the `ssh-agent` by issuing the `ssh-add` command and entering your passphrase:
```
ssh-add $HOME/.ssh/your_file_name
```

5. Done! Now restart your Powershell and even Windows if necessary.
